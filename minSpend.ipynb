    "This tool appraises whether it is plausible that a given individual won a set of lottery prizes honestly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code reads a comma-separated values file (CSV) of wins and odds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The user inputs an upper bound on the number of players (for instance, one might assume that the number of people playing the lottery isn't greater than the number of residents of the state), and a tiny \"threshold\" probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code outputs a lower bound on the amount all those people would have had to spend for any of them to have a tiny chance of winning so often, where \"tiny\" is the threshold number chosen by the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the required spending amount is, for example, several times the median house price in the state, it may call into question whether the winner won honestly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The current version can analyze data for only one gambler at a time. \n",
    "\n",
    "The code implements the mathematics described in the first link below. The third link is to a public lecture about the method, and results for reported lottery winners in Florida. \n",
    "The fourth and fifth links are news stories that relied on such calculations.\n",
